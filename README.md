# Turael Skipping Counter
A counter plugin to track drystreaks since desired Slayer task

Features to add:
- Store dryest value for task

- Add check that dry counter can only increment when an option for desired task is selected
  
- Calc chance of desired task
  - This could be printed in chatbox

- Update name (Task Dry Counter ?)
  
- How does it work when doing slayer regularly?
  - Currently does not increment count when you complete a regular slayer task, only when you reset your slayer task. Is there a way around this?
  - What about skipping a task with slayer points?


Completed Features:
- Ability to choose what your desired task is
- Counter colour depending on how dry you are for task
- Track reset count between sessions
- Infobox load on task reset, disappears after 1-5mins
